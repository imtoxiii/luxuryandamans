## Month-by-month breakdown
- November–February: Peak season; perfect beach weather and diving conditions
- March–April: Warm and clear; great for snorkeling and bioluminescence sightings
- May–June: Pre-monsoon showers; fewer crowds, lush landscapes
- July–September: Monsoon; rough seas, but great value stays and dramatic skies
- October: Transition month; improving seas and fresh greenery
