      question: 'What is the absolute best month to visit Andaman?',
      answer:
        'If you want the most reliable weather and calm seas, December to February are the safest bets. For value with good conditions, aim for late October–November or March–April.'

      question: 'Is monsoon a bad time to travel to Andaman?',

    },
    {
      question: 'When is the best time for scuba diving and snorkeling?',
      answer:
        'Scuba is best November–April for stable visibility. Snorkeling is great most of the year, but calm sea days in November–March offer the clearest water and easiest entries.'

      question: 'Will ferries get cancelled in the monsoon?',
      answer:
        'Occasionally, yes, during rough weather. Book morning ferries, keep buffer time, and have a plan B. Travel insurance is recommended during the monsoon months.'
