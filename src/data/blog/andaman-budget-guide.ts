      question: 'What is a realistic daily budget for a trip to Andaman?',
      answer:
        'A backpacker can manage on ₹1,500–₹2,500 per day. A more comfortable budget traveler should aim for ₹3,000–₹5,000 per day, covering decent accommodation, food, and basic activities.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How can I save the most money on ferries?',
      answer:
        'Opt for government-run ferries over private catamarans. They are significantly cheaper, though they take longer and have a more basic booking process. Book them as soon as you arrive in Port Blair.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is it cheaper to book a package or plan independently?',
      answer:
        'For short trips, a well-negotiated package can sometimes be cheaper as operators get bulk rates. For longer, more flexible trips, planning independently often allows for more savings, especially if you stay in homestays and eat locally.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Which is the most budget-friendly island to stay on?',
      answer:
        'Neil Island (Shaheed Dweep) is generally more budget-friendly than Havelock (Swaraj Dweep) in terms of accommodation and food. Port Blair also has a wide range of affordable stay options.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the cheapest way to get from the airport to my hotel?',
      answer:
        'Auto-rickshaws are the cheapest option right outside the Port Blair airport. Agree on the fare before you start the ride. Avoid the more expensive pre-paid airport taxis if you are on a tight budget.',

## 15 Essential Tips to Save Money in the Andamans

### 1. Travel in the Shoulder Season
Avoid the peak crowds and prices of December-January. Travel in October, November, February, or March for a great balance of good weather and lower costs. The monsoon season (May-September) offers the biggest discounts.

### 2. Book Flights Way in Advance
This is the most crucial step. Use flight comparison tools and book at least 3-4 months before your travel dates, especially if you're flying from North India.

### 3. Choose Government Ferries
For inter-island travel (e.g., Port Blair to Havelock), government ferries are your most affordable option. They are slower but safe and scenic.

### 4. Eat at Local "Dhabas" and Eateries
Skip the fancy resort restaurants. The best and most affordable food is found in small, local eateries. A seafood thali at a local joint is both delicious and easy on the wallet.

### 5. Rent a Scooter
On islands like Havelock and Neil, renting a scooter for ₹400-₹600 per day is the cheapest and most flexible way to explore all the beaches at your own pace.

### 6. Limit Your Islands
Island hopping adds to your ferry costs and travel time. For a trip under 6 days, stick to two main islands like Port Blair and Havelock to minimize expenses.

### 7. Stay in Homestays or Guesthouses
Choose locally-run guesthouses, homestays, or beach huts over large resorts. They offer an authentic experience and are much more affordable.

### 8. Enjoy Free Activities
The best things in Andaman are often free! Spend your days beach hopping, swimming, and watching spectacular sunsets. Radhanagar Beach, Laxmanpur Beach, and Kalapathar Beach cost nothing to enjoy.

### 9. Get a BSNL SIM Card
If you need connectivity, a local BSNL SIM card is the most reliable and cheapest option, as other networks have patchy service outside of Port Blair.

### 10. Carry Your Own Snorkel Mask
If you love snorkeling, consider bringing your own mask. You'll save on daily rental costs and can snorkel whenever you find a calm spot.

### 11. Group Up for Activities
For activities like boat trips to Elephant Beach, find other travelers to share the cost of the boat. This can significantly reduce the per-person price.

### 12. Drink Tap Water (After Purifying)
Instead of buying plastic water bottles, carry a reusable bottle with a built-in purifier or use purification tablets. It's both eco-friendly and budget-friendly.

### 13. Pre-Book Packages in the Off-Season
If you prefer a package, book it during the off-season or shoulder season. You can get incredible deals that include hotels, ferries, and some activities.

### 14. Set a Daily Budget
Decide on a daily spending limit and stick to it. This helps you track your expenses and avoid overspending on non-essential items.

### 15. Bargain Respectfully
At local markets for souvenirs or with auto-rickshaw drivers, it's okay to bargain, but do so with a smile and a respectful attitude.
