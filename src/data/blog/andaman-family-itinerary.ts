## Day 1: Arrival in Port Blair & A Touch of History
Your Andaman adventure begins in Port Blair.
- **Morning/Afternoon:** Arrive at Veer Savarkar International Airport (IXB), and we'll transfer you to your hotel. Let the kids settle in and acclimatize to the island air.
- **Evening:** Head to the Cellular Jail. The history might be too intense for very young children, but the impressive architecture is worth seeing. The evening Light and Sound Show is often a hit with older kids.

## Day 2: Ferry to Havelock & Asia's Best Beach
Time to hit the islands!
- **Morning:** Take a comfortable, air-conditioned private ferry to Havelock Island (Swaraj Dweep). The journey is about 90 minutes.
- **Afternoon:** Check into your family-friendly resort and have a relaxed lunch.
- **Evening:** Visit the world-famous Radhanagar Beach (Beach No. 7) for sunset. Its vast expanse of soft sand and calm, shallow waters make it the perfect natural swimming pool for kids.

## Day 3: Underwater Wonders at Elephant Beach
A day of excitement and marine exploration.

## Day 5: Return to Port Blair & Departure
Time to head home with a bag full of memories.

## Top 5 Tips for Traveling to Andaman with Kids
1.  **Book Direct Flights:** Choose direct flights to Port Blair to minimize travel time and avoid tiring layovers.

4.  **Stay Hydrated:** Ensure everyone drinks plenty of water, especially coconut water, to stay hydrated in the tropical climate.
