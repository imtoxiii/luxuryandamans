    ## Your 7-Day Romantic Andaman Itinerary

    Our journey follows the classic romantic trail: **Port Blair (1 Night) → Havelock Island (3 Nights) → Neil Island (2 Nights)**. This route offers the perfect mix of activity, relaxation, and pure, unadulterated romance.

    ### Day 1: Arrival in Port Blair – The Adventure Begins
    Your romantic escapade begins the moment you land at Veer Savarkar International Airport in Port Blair. The warm, humid air and the scent of the sea will instantly switch you to vacation mode.
    - **Afternoon:** Check into your hotel and freshen up. Head to **Corbyn's Cove Beach**, a serene, coconut-palm-fringed beach perfect for a romantic stroll.
    - **Evening:** Prepare to be moved by the **Sound and Light Show at Cellular Jail**. It’s a poignant, powerful retelling of India's freedom struggle that will leave you with a sense of awe and patriotism.

    ### Day 2: Journey to Havelock Island (Swaraj Dweep) – A Slice of Paradise
    Today, you leave the 'capital' behind for the star attraction: Havelock Island.
    - **Morning:** Catch a high-speed private ferry to Havelock. The journey itself is beautiful, with endless blue sea on all sides.
    - **Afternoon:** Check into your pre-booked beach resort. We highly recommend one with a private beach for those uninterrupted moments.
    - **Evening:** Head to the world-famous **Radhanagar Beach (Beach No. 7)**. Voted one of Asia's best beaches, its sunset is a spectacle you'll cherish forever. The sky explodes in shades of orange, pink, and purple. It's the perfect moment for that classic honeymoon silhouette photo.

    ### Day 3: Havelock – Underwater Wonders & Beach Bliss
    Time to discover what lies beneath the shimmering surface of the Andaman Sea.
    - **Morning:** Experience the magic of the underwater world with a **couple's introductory scuba dive**. No swimming skills needed! Under expert guidance, you'll discover vibrant coral reefs and a kaleidoscope of fish. It's a bonding experience like no other.
    - **Afternoon:** For more water-based fun, take a boat to **Elephant Beach**. It's the hub for water sports like snorkelling, sea walking, and jet skiing.
    - **Evening:** This is the night for the ultimate romantic gesture: a **private candlelight dinner** on the beach. With the sound of the waves and a star-studded sky, it’s a memory you'll both treasure.

    ### Day 4: Havelock – Leisure, Exploration, and a Magical Evening
    Today is all about finding your own pace.
    - **Morning:** Rent a scooter and explore Havelock like locals. The roads are scenic and easy to navigate. Drive to **Kalapathar Beach**, known for its black rocks and tranquil vibe.
    - **Afternoon:** Indulge in a relaxing **couple's spa treatment** at your resort. Let the expert hands massage away any lingering wedding stress.
    - **Evening (Optional):** If it's the right season (usually moonless nights), don't miss the **bioluminescence kayaking tour**. Paddling through water that glows with every touch is a surreal, magical experience.

    ### Day 5: Hello, Neil Island (Shaheed Dweep) – A Serene Escape
    Next up is Neil Island, Havelock's quieter, more rustic sister. It's the perfect place to slow down and simply be with each other.
    - **Morning:** Take a short ferry ride from Havelock to Neil Island.
    - **Afternoon:** Visit **Bharatpur Beach**, famous for its shallow waters and beautiful coral reefs. A ride in a glass-bottom boat is a must-do here.
    - **Evening:** Go to **Laxmanpur Beach** for another spectacular sunset. At low tide, you can walk to see the stunning **Natural Bridge**, a natural rock formation that is one of Neil's most famous landmarks.

    ### Day 6: Neil Island – Sunrise, Relaxation, and Rustic Charm
    Your last full day in paradise.
    - **Morning:** Wake up early to catch the sunrise at **Sitapur Beach (Beach No. 5)**. The view is absolutely worth the early start.
    - **Day:** Neil Island is tiny and best explored on a bicycle. Rent a pair and cycle through paddy fields, quaint villages, and deserted beaches. It’s simple, romantic, and lets you connect with the island's soul.
    - **Evening:** Enjoy a quiet, final dinner at a local restaurant, savouring the fresh seafood.

    ### Day 7: Farewell, Andamans!
    - **Morning:** Take the ferry back to Port Blair. Depending on your flight schedule, you might have time for some last-minute souvenir shopping at **Aberdeen Bazaar**.
    - **Afternoon:** Head to the airport with a bag full of memories and a heart full of love, promising to return.

    ## Must-Do Romantic Experiences in Andaman
    - **Private Candlelight Dinner:** An absolute must for honeymooners.
    - **Couples Scuba Diving:** Discover a new world together.
    - **Sunset Cruise:** Sail into the sunset on a private boat.
    - **Couples Photoshoot:** Capture your love against the stunning Andaman backdrop. Check out our <a href="/packages/andaman-honeymoon-package">honeymoon packages</a> which can include this.
    - **Stay in a Beach Villa:** Wake up to the sound of the waves.

    ## Practical Tips for the Perfect Andaman Honeymoon
    - **Best Time to Visit:** October to May is ideal, with pleasant weather and calm seas.
    - **Book in Advance:** Flights, hotels, and private ferries get booked up fast, especially during peak season (December-January).
    - **Pack Smart:** Light cottons, swimwear, sunscreen, insect repellent, a hat, and sunglasses are essential. Don't forget a dressy outfit for your romantic dinners!
    - **Connectivity:** Mobile networks can be patchy. BSNL and Airtel work best. Inform your family you might be less connected. It’s a great chance for a digital detox!
    - **Cash is King:** While UPI is available in Port Blair and Havelock, it's wise to carry enough cash, especially in Neil Island.
