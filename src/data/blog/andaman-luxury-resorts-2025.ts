    {
      question: "Are there good vegetarian and Jain food options in these luxury resorts?",
      answer: "Yes, absolutely. All luxury resorts in the Andamans, especially the ones listed here, have excellent multi-cuisine restaurants with extensive vegetarian menus. For Jain food or other specific dietary needs, it's best to inform the resort at the time of booking, and they will gladly accommodate your request."
    },
    {
      question: "Which luxury resort is best for families with children?",
      answer: "For families, Taj Exotica in Havelock is a fantastic choice due to its large villas, kids' club, and array of activities. Symphony Samudra in Port Blair is another excellent option with its large property and multiple pools. SeaShell, Neil also offers a great pool and a relaxed environment suitable for families."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it better to stay in Havelock or Neil Island for a luxury experience?",
      answer: "Havelock offers more options for high-end, opulent luxury with resorts like Taj Exotica. Neil Island provides a 'barefoot luxury' experience—it's more about tranquility and nature, with beautiful resorts that are comfortable and upscale but in a more laid-back setting."
    },
    {
      question: "How far are these resorts from the jetty or airport?",
      answer: "In Port Blair, resorts are typically a 20-45 minute drive from the airport. In Havelock and Neil, most top resorts are located within a 15-25 minute drive from the main jetty. Resorts always offer pickup and drop services, often in comfortable, private vehicles."
    },
    {
      question: "Do these resorts have private beach access?",
      answer: "Most of the top-tier resorts like Taj Exotica, Barefoot at Radhanagar, and Munjoh have their own private or semi-private beach access, which is a major highlight and ensures a crowd-free experience."
    },
    {
        question: "Is it safe to travel with elderly parents to these resorts?",
        answer: "Yes, these luxury resorts are very accommodating for elderly guests. They offer buggy services for transport within the property, have accessible rooms, and can cater to specific dietary and medical needs. It's always a good idea to discuss any specific requirements with the resort beforehand."

## How to Choose & Book Your Resort

*   **For Honeymooners:** Prioritize resorts with private pool villas and special romantic dining options like Taj Exotica or Munjoh. Our [Andaman Honeymoon Guide](/blog/andaman-honeymoon-guide) has more tips.
*   **For Families:** Look for resorts with larger rooms or villas, a kids' club, and a good swimming pool, like Taj Exotica or Symphony Samudra. Properties with extensive grounds are great for children.
*   **Booking Tip for Indian Travellers:** Andaman has become a very popular destination. For travel during peak seasons like Diwali, Christmas, or summer school holidays (May-June), you must book at least 4-6 months in advance. For the best value, consider the shoulder season (September-October & Feb-March) when the weather is still great but prices are lower.
*   **Look for Packages:** Often, booking a complete package that includes flights, ferries, and hotels through a trusted operator can offer better value and a more seamless experience than booking each component separately.
