### Is Andaman Worth Visiting in the Monsoon? Absolutely!

Imagine sipping chai while watching the rain kiss the sea, exploring lush, freshly-washed landscapes, and enjoying top-tier resorts without the tourist rush. That's Andaman in the monsoon for you! While many travellers stick to the peak season, the rainy months (June to September) unveil a different, more serene side of the islands. For an Indian traveller looking for a peaceful yet adventurous getaway, this is a golden opportunity.

### The Monsoon Experience: What to Really Expect

**Weather & Scenery:** The Andamans don't see continuous downpours. Expect a cycle of rain and sun, with dramatic, cloudy skies perfect for photography. The islands are at their greenest, making for breathtaking views.
