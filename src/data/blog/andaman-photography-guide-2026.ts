## Andaman Through the Lens

Andaman is a photographer's dream — turquoise lagoons that glow at dawn, lush jungles that frame every shore, and underwater worlds that rival National Geographic footage. Whether you shoot on a DSLR or a smartphone, this guide helps you bring home photos that do these islands justice.

## Best Sunrise Locations

### 1. Kalapathar Beach, Havelock — The Icon
- **Time:** Arrive by 5:00 AM
- **What Makes It Special:** Black volcanic rocks against a glowing turquoise sea
- **Tip:** Shoot from the rocks on the left side for the best foreground composition
- **Gear:** Wide-angle lens or phone ultrawide

### 2. Sitapur Beach, Neil Island — Serene & Empty
- **Time:** 5:15 AM
- **What Makes It Special:** Dramatic cliff backdrop, almost no tourists
- **Tip:** Tide pools create natural mirrors — shoot the sky's reflection in them

### 3. Chidiya Tapu — The Bird Island Sunrise
- **Time:** 5:00 AM
- **What Makes It Special:** Dense mangroves and a biological park setting
- **Tip:** Best combined with bird photography — bring a telephoto lens

---

## Best Sunset Locations

### 1. Radhanagar Beach, Havelock — Asia's Best
- **Time:** 5:00–5:30 PM
- **Tip:** Shoot silhouettes of people at the shoreline for dramatic frames
- **Composition:** Walk to the far-right end for fewer crowds and a more natural frame

### 2. Laxmanpur Beach, Neil Island — Pastel Skies
- **Time:** 5:00 PM
- **Tip:** The natural rock arch creates an incredible frame for the setting sun
- **Best Month:** December–February for the most vivid pink-orange skies

### 3. Corbyn's Cove, Port Blair — City Sunset
- **Time:** 5:15 PM
- **Tip:** Palm-lined beach — perfect for that classic tropical postcard shot

---

## Underwater Photography Tips

### For GoPro Users
- Use the **underwater housing** (mandatory below 3 metres)
- Shoot in **wide mode** — you want as much of the reef in frame as possible
- Get **close to your subject** — water reduces contrast, so closer = sharper
- Use **natural light** whenever possible (top 5 metres has plenty)
- **Stabilize:** Hold the camera with both hands and kick gently with fins

### For Phone Users
- Buy a **waterproof pouch** (₹500–₹800 from Aberdeen Bazaar)
- Test it in a bucket of water BEFORE you enter the sea
- Shoot in **Video mode** and extract stills later (more forgiving of movement)
- At the surface, shoot **half-in, half-out** (over-under) for the most dramatic effect

## Drone Photography Rules

⚠️ **Important:** Andaman has military installations. Drone rules are strict:
1. **Apply for a permit** from the District Magistrate's office, Port Blair (2 weeks in advance)
2. **Absolutely banned** near: Cellular Jail, airports, naval base, tribal reserves
3. **Allowed with permit** at: Beaches on Havelock, Neil Island (daylight only)
4. **Height limit:** 120 metres AGL (Above Ground Level)
5. **DGCA registration** is mandatory for all drones in India

**Pro Tip:** If you're unsure, don't bring your drone. The fine for illegal drone use in restricted areas can be ₹1,00,000+.
