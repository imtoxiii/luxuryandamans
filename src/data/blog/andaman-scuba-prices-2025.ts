## Budgeting for Your Underwater Adventure: Andaman Scuba Costs in 2025

So, you're ready to explore the breathtaking underwater world of the Andaman Islands? Awesome choice! But before you take the plunge, let's talk about one of the most important parts of planning: the budget. This guide gives you a clear and updated breakdown of scuba diving prices in Andaman for 2025, so you can plan your trip without any surprises.

## For Beginners: Your First Dive Experience

If you're new to scuba, the **Discover Scuba Dive (DSD)** is your gateway. It's a hassle-free, no-certification-required experience.

- **Price Range:** ₹3,500 – ₹5,500 per person.
- **What's Included:** This price almost always includes your equipment rental, a dedicated certified instructor, and a dive lasting 30-45 minutes.
- **Photos & Videos:** Most operators include complimentary photos and videos, but it's always good to confirm beforehand. This is a huge value-add as you'll have amazing memories to share!

## For Certified Divers: Fun Dives

Already have your certification? Great! The Andamans are your playground. Fun dives are for certified divers who want to explore the best sites.

- **Single Dive:** ₹3,000 – ₹4,500
- **Two-Tank Dive (2 Dives):** ₹5,500 – ₹7,000
- **Dive Packages:** Booking multiple dives (e.g., 6 or 10 dives) can bring the per-dive cost down significantly. It's the best option for avid divers.

## Getting Certified: PADI/SSI Course Costs

Andaman is a fantastic and affordable place to get your diving license.

- **PADI/SSI Open Water Diver:** ₹24,000 – ₹28,000. This is an all-inclusive price covering your manual, training, equipment, and 4 open water dives.
- **PADI/SSI Advanced Open Water Diver:** ₹20,000 – ₹24,000. This includes 5 adventure dives and all necessary materials.

## Key Factors Influencing Price

- **Island:** Prices in Havelock (Swaraj Dweep) are very competitive due to the high number of dive shops. Neil Island (Shaheed Dweep) can sometimes be slightly more expensive but offers a quieter experience.
- **Dive Site:** Some exclusive or deep dive sites might have a small surcharge due to longer boat rides and higher fuel consumption.
- **Season:** While prices are generally stable, booking during the peak season (December-January) might require advance payment to secure your slot.

## Smart Tips for a Budget-Friendly Dive Trip

1.  **Book in Advance:** Especially your courses, to ensure availability and sometimes lock in a better price.
2.  **Look for Packages:** Many dive shops offer packages that combine dives with accommodation, which can be very economical.
3.  **Travel in the Shoulder Season:** Months like October, November, February, and March offer fantastic diving conditions with fewer crowds.
