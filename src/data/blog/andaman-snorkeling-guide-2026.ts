## Why Andaman Is India's Snorkeling Capital

The Andaman Sea sits at the crossroads of the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal, creating one of the most biodiverse marine corridors in the world. Crystal-clear waters, vibrant coral gardens, and over 1,200 species of marine life make these islands the undisputed best place in India for snorkeling.

Unlike scuba diving, snorkeling needs **zero certification, zero experience, and zero swimming skills**. If you can breathe through a tube and float in a life jacket, you're ready.

## Essential Tips for Better Snorkeling

- **Don't touch the coral** — it's a living organism and contact kills it
- **Apply reef-safe sunscreen** — chemical sunscreens bleach coral
- **Breathe slowly and steadily** — panicking wastes energy and fogs your mask
- **De-fog your mask** — spit in it and rinse with seawater before putting it on
- **Wear a rash guard** — protects from sunburn and jellyfish stings
- **Never snorkel alone** — always go with a buddy or guide

## Snorkeling vs Scuba Diving: Which Should You Pick?

|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Cost | ₹600–₹2,000 | ₹3,500–₹6,000 |
