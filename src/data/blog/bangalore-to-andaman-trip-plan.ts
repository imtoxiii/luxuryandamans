## Your Andaman Escape from Bangalore Starts Here

Swapping the tech corridors of Bangalore for the turquoise waters and white-sand beaches of the Andaman Islands is easier than you think. Thanks to great flight connectivity, India's island paradise is just a short journey away. This guide provides a step-by-step plan to make your dream Andaman vacation a reality, covering everything from flights and budgets to the perfect itinerary.

## Flights: Getting from Bangalore (BLR) to Port Blair (IXZ)

This is your first and most important booking. Bangalore has excellent connectivity to Port Blair, making the journey smooth and relatively quick.

- **Flight Options:** While direct flights are rare and seasonal, you'll find plenty of convenient one-stop flights, usually with a short layover in Chennai (MAA) or Kolkata (CCU).
- **Airlines:** IndiGo, Vistara, and Air India are the primary carriers on this route.
- **Travel Time:** Expect a total travel time of around 4.5 to 6.5 hours, including the layover.
- **Booking Tip:** To get the best fares (typically ₹7,000 - ₹13,000 one-way during the shoulder season), aim to book your tickets at least 30-45 days in advance. Use price comparison websites, but consider booking directly with the airline.

## The Perfect 6-Night, 7-Day Itinerary

This classic itinerary gives you the perfect blend of adventure, relaxation, and exploration.

- **Day 1: Arrival in Port Blair & Cellular Jail:** Arrive in Port Blair, check into your hotel, and spend the evening at the historic Cellular Jail for the moving Light and Sound Show.
- **Day 2-4: Havelock Island (Swaraj Dweep):** Take a morning ferry to Havelock. Spend the next three days exploring the world-famous Radhanagar Beach, snorkeling at Elephant Beach, and enjoying the island's vibrant cafe scene.
- **Day 5-6: Neil Island (Shaheed Dweep):** Hop on a ferry to the quieter Neil Island. Visit the Natural Bridge, watch the sunset at Laxmanpur Beach, and relax on the serene Bharatpur Beach.
- **Day 7: Return to Port Blair & Departure:** Take a morning ferry back to Port Blair to catch your flight back to Bangalore, filled with unforgettable memories.

## Budget Breakdown for a Couple (from Bangalore)

Here’s a realistic budget estimate for a 7-day trip for two people.

- **Return Flights:** ₹25,000 - ₹45,000 (depending on how early you book)
- **Inter-Island Ferries:** ₹8,000 - ₹12,000 (for private, air-conditioned ferries)
- **Accommodation:** ₹30,000 - ₹70,000 (ranging from comfortable 3-star hotels to luxury resorts)
- **Activities & Watersports:** ₹10,000 - ₹25,000 (including scuba, snorkeling, etc.)
- **Food & Local Transport:** ₹12,000 - ₹20,000

**Total Estimated Cost for a Couple:** ₹85,000 - ₹1,72,000

## Pro-Tips for Bangalore Travelers

- **Plan Around Long Weekends:** Bangalore has several long weekends throughout the year. Planning your Andaman trip around these can help you save on leave.
- **Flight-Ferry Buffer:** On your departure day, book a ferry from Neil/Havelock that reaches Port Blair at least 4-5 hours before your flight to Bangalore. This accounts for any potential delays.
- **Pack Smart:** Pack light, quick-drying clothes, reef-safe sunscreen, a good power bank, and a waterproof bag.

      question: 'Are there direct flights from Bangalore to Andaman?',
      answer:
        'Direct flights from Bangalore (BLR) to Port Blair (IXZ) are not always available and depend on the season and airline schedules. Most often, you will find convenient one-stop flights via Chennai or Kolkata with a short layover.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the best time of year to plan a trip from Bangalore?',
      answer:
        'The best time is from October to May, when the weather is sunny and the seas are calm. For budget travelers from Bangalore, the shoulder months of October, November, February, and March offer a great balance of good weather and more affordable flight prices.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How should I handle mobile connectivity in Andaman?',
      answer:
        'Only Airtel and BSNL have reliable networks, primarily in Port Blair and populated areas of Havelock and Neil. Jio and Vodafone have very limited to no service. Inform your family and friends, and download offline maps before you leave Bangalore.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is it better to book a package from Bangalore or plan everything myself?',
      answer:
        "Booking a package from a reputable local Andaman operator can be more convenient and often more cost-effective. They handle all inter-island ferries, transfers, and activity bookings, which can be complex to manage yourself. Planning on your own offers more flexibility but requires more research."
    },
    {
      question: 'Is UPI (like Google Pay/PhonePe) widely accepted in Andaman?',
      answer:
        "While some larger hotels and restaurants in Port Blair and Havelock might accept UPI, it is not widely available, especially in Neil Island and at smaller shops. Network issues can also cause payments to fail. It is essential to carry enough cash."
