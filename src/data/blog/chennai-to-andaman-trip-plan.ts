## The Easiest Gateway to Paradise: Your Andaman Trip from Chennai

For residents of Chennai, the Andaman Islands aren't just a dream destination; they are the most accessible tropical paradise you can fly to. With the shortest flight times and excellent connectivity, planning a trip from Chennai is a breeze. This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know, from booking direct flights to crafting the perfect budget and itinerary for 2025.

## Flights: The Chennai Advantage - Fly Direct to Port Blair (IXZ)

Chennai (MAA) enjoys the best flight connectivity to the Andamans among all Indian metro cities.

- **Direct Flights:** This is the biggest perk! Several airlines like IndiGo and Air India operate daily non-stop flights to Port Blair.
- **Flight Duration:** You can be in Port Blair in just 2 hours and 15 minutes. This short travel time means you can land and start your vacation on the same day.
- **Booking Strategy:** For the best prices (usually ₹5,500 - ₹11,000 one-way), book 30-45 days in advance. Last-minute fares can be significantly higher.

## The Ideal 6-Night, 7-Day Island-Hopping Itinerary

This itinerary is perfectly paced for a first-time visitor from Chennai, blending iconic sights with relaxation.

- **Day 1: Arrival & Local Sightseeing:** Take a morning flight from Chennai. Arrive in Port Blair, check in, and visit the Cellular Jail. End the day with the patriotic light and sound show.
- **Day 2-4: The Havelock Experience:** Catch a morning ferry to Havelock Island (Swaraj Dweep). Spend your days soaking in the beauty of Radhanagar Beach, snorkeling at Elephant Beach, and exploring the island's famous cafes.
- **Day 5-6: The Serenity of Neil Island:** Take a ferry to the tranquil Neil Island (Shaheed Dweep). Discover its unique beaches like Laxmanpur for sunset, Bharatpur for water sports, and the Natural Bridge.
