## Trading Cityscapes for Seascapes: Your Andaman Journey from Delhi

Escaping the hustle and bustle of Delhi for the serene, palm-fringed shores of the Andaman Islands is the perfect way to reset and rejuvenate. While the journey is longer than from other metros, a well-planned trip makes it absolutely worth it. This guide is tailor-made for Delhiites, covering everything from the smartest flight bookings to an itinerary that makes the most of your travel time.

## Flights: Navigating Your Trip from Delhi (DEL) to Port Blair (IXZ)

Getting to the Andamans from Delhi requires a bit of planning, but it's straightforward.

- **Flight Connectivity:** While direct flights are rare and often seasonal, there are numerous convenient one-stop options available daily. Common layover cities are Kolkata (CCU) and Chennai (MAA).
- **Airlines:** Vistara, IndiGo, and Air India are the most reliable carriers for this route, offering good service and baggage allowances.
- **Total Travel Time:** Be prepared for a journey of 5.5 to 8 hours, including the layover.
- **Smart Booking Tip:** To secure the best fares (₹8,500 - ₹15,000 one-way in the shoulder season), book your tickets at least 45-60 days in advance.

## The Ideal 7-Day Itinerary for Delhi Travelers

This itinerary is designed to maximize your island time and minimize travel fatigue.

- **Day 1: Arrival in Port Blair & Relaxation:** Your flight will likely arrive in the afternoon. Check into your hotel, relax, and take a leisurely stroll at Corbyn's Cove Beach in the evening.
- **Day 2-4: Havelock (Swaraj Dweep) - The Island Jewel:** Take an early morning ferry. Over the next three days, immerse yourself in the island's beauty. Witness the magical sunset at Radhanagar Beach, go snorkeling at Elephant Beach, and perhaps even try a Discover Scuba Dive.
- **Day 5-6: Neil (Shaheed Dweep) - A Slice of Serenity:** Hop over to the quieter Neil Island. Visit the stunning Natural Bridge at low tide, watch the sunset at Laxmanpur Beach, and enjoy the laid-back atmosphere.
- **Day 7: Return Journey:** Take a morning ferry back to Port Blair to catch your flight home, ensuring you have ample buffer time.

## A Realistic Budget for a Couple's Trip from Delhi

Here is an estimated budget for a comfortable 7-day trip for two.

- **Return Flights:** ₹30,000 - ₹55,000 (this is the biggest variable; book early!)
- **Inter-Island Ferries:** ₹8,000 - ₹12,000
- **Accommodation:** ₹30,000 - ₹70,000
- **Activities & Watersports:** ₹10,000 - ₹25,000
- **Food & Local Transport:** ₹12,000 - ₹20,000

**Total Estimated Cost for a Couple:** ₹90,000 - ₹1,82,000

## Key Tips for a Smooth Trip from Delhi

- **Embrace the Layover:** Choose flights with a 2-3 hour layover. It's less stressful than a short connection and gives you time to stretch and have a meal.
- **Plan for a Longer Trip:** Given the travel time from Delhi, a trip of at least 6 nights and 7 days is recommended to make it feel worthwhile.
- **Carry Essentials:** Pack any specific medications, a good book for the flight, and a neck pillow for comfort.
