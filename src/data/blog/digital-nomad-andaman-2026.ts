# Can You *Really* Work from Andaman in 2026?

If you asked me this three years ago, I would have laughed. "Sure, if you want to send one email per hour," I'd say.

But things have changed. Drastically.

With the full stabilization of the Chennai-Andaman & Nicobar Islands (CANI) optical fiber cable and the aggressive rollout of 5G by Airtel and Jio, the Andaman Islands have transformed from a "digital detox" zone to a legitimate workation contender.

My partner and I spent the last three months working from Port Blair, Havelock (Swaraj Dweep), and Neil Island (Shaheed Dweep). We took Zoom calls, pushed code to GitHub, and streamed Netflix.

Here is the **brutally honest** truth about being a digital nomad in Andaman in 2026.

## The Internet Situation: Speed Tests & Reality

Let's get the most important question out of the way first.

### Port Blair: The Safe Zone
Port Blair is as good as any mainland city now.
*   **Fiber:** Most hotels and homestays have high-speed fiber (FTTH). We consistently got **100-200 Mbps**.
*   **Mobile Data:** Airtel 5G is blazing fast (300+ Mbps). Jio 5G is reliable but sometimes patchy indoors.
*   **Reliability:** 9/10. Occasional power cuts affect routers, so ensure your place has a UPS.

### Havelock (Swaraj Dweep): The Sweet Spot
This is where you want to be. The vibe is unmatched, and the internet is finally "workable."
*   **Fiber:** Available in most good resorts and cafes. Speeds range from **30-80 Mbps**.
*   **Mobile Data:** Airtel 5G works near the main road (Govind Nagar, Vijay Nagar). Inside dense jungle resorts, it drops to 4G.
*   **Reliability:** 7/10. Storms can knock out power and fiber lines for hours. **Always have a backup mobile hotspot.**

### Neil Island (Shaheed Dweep): The "Deep Work" Zone
Neil is for writing, coding, or editing—tasks that don't require constant video calls.
*   **Fiber:** Rare. Only top luxury resorts have it.
*   **Mobile Data:** Airtel 4G is decent (10-20 Mbps). Enough for Slack and emails, risky for Zoom.
*   **Reliability:** 5/10. Treat Neil as a weekend getaway, not your main office.

> **Pro Tip:** Do NOT rely on Vodafone/Vi or BSNL 4G for work. They are practically non-existent for data. Stick to Airtel or Jio.

## Where to Work: Best Cafes & Coworking

Andaman doesn't have WeWork. It has "beach work." Here are our favorite spots:

### 1. Something Different (Havelock)
This was our daily office.
*   **The Vibe:** Beachfront, airy, and quiet during the day.
*   **WiFi:** Solid. They have a backup line.
*   **Power:** Generator backup available.
*   **Coffee:** The iced latte is a lifesaver in the humidity.

### 2. Icy Spicy (Port Blair)
If you're stuck in Port Blair, this is a reliable spot. It's indoors (AC!), has strong WiFi, and the food menu is huge. Great for taking calls without background wind noise.

### 3. Full Moon Cafe (Havelock)
Best for creative work. The view of the ocean is distracting in the best way. The WiFi is okay for emails but don't try to host a webinar here.

## Cost of Living: The "Island Tax"

Living in Andaman is **more expensive** than Goa, Bali, or Thailand. Everything has to be shipped from the mainland.

Here is a monthly breakdown for a couple living comfortably in Havelock:

| Expense | Cost (INR) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Accommodation** | ₹35,000 - ₹60,000 | AC room with kitchen access in a nice homestay/resort. |
| **Scooter Rental** | ₹10,000 - ₹12,000 | Monthly rate. Daily rate is ₹500. |
| **Food (Eating Out)** | ₹25,000 - ₹35,000 | Approx. ₹800-1000 per day for two. |
| **Internet/Data** | ₹2,000 | Mobile data packs + extra coffee for cafe WiFi. |
| **Activities** | ₹10,000 | Weekend dives, kayaking, entry fees. |
| **Total** | **₹82,000 - ₹1,19,000** | **($1000 - $1450 USD)** |

**Budget Tip:** You can slash costs by staying in **Govind Nagar** (market area) instead of the beach resorts in Vijay Nagar. Look for "homestays" rather than "hotels."

## The Challenges (Nobody Tells You This)

It's not all coconuts and sunsets.

1.  **Power Cuts:** They are frequent. In Havelock, power might go out for 2-3 hours a day. **Essential Gear:** A good power bank for your laptop and a USB-powered fan.
2.  **Humidity:** It is relentless. Your clothes will never feel fully dry. Electronics can get moisture damage. Keep silica gel packs in your laptop bag.
3.  **Limited Nightlife:** If you're used to the buzzing nomad scenes of Canggu or Lisbon, you might get bored. Nightlife here ends at 11 PM. It's about early mornings, not late nights.
4.  **Vegetables are Pricey:** If you plan to cook, be ready to pay double the mainland price for fresh veggies.

## Visa & Permits (For Foreigners)

*   **Indian Nationals:** No permit needed. Just fly in.
*   **Foreign Nationals:** You need an Indian Visa. The **Restricted Area Permit (RAP)** is no longer required for the main islands (Port Blair, Havelock, Neil) for visits up to 30 days.
*   **Registration:** You will be registered at the airport immigration counter. It's a quick process.

## The Verdict: Should You Go?

**Go if:**
*   You love nature, diving, and quiet mornings.
*   You can work asynchronously or have flexible hours.
*   You want to detox from city chaos but stay connected.

**Don't go if:**
*   You need 100% uptime for trading or live streaming.
*   You need a vibrant party scene to socialize.
*   You are on a shoestring budget (Goa is cheaper).

Andaman in 2026 is a digital nomad's raw, beautiful, and slightly chaotic paradise. If you can handle the occasional power cut with a smile, you'll never want to leave.

      question: "Which SIM card is best for digital nomads in Andaman?",
      answer: "Airtel is the undisputed king. It works in 90% of tourist areas. Jio is a strong second best. Vodafone/Vi is useless."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I find long-term rentals in Havelock?",
      answer: "Yes, but they aren't listed on Airbnb. You have to land there, rent a scooter, and ask around in the Govind Nagar area. Look for 'Homestays' signs."
    },
    {
      question: "Is Starlink available in Andaman?",
      answer: "As of early 2026, Starlink is technically operational but regulatory approval is still in grey areas. Stick to local fiber and 5G for now."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the best month for a workation?",
      answer: "January to April. The weather is perfect—sunny, calm seas, and lower humidity. Monsoon (June-Sept) is risky for internet stability."
