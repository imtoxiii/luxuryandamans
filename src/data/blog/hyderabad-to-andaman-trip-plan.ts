## Budgeting for Your Trip: A Couple's Guide from Hyderabad

## Essential Tips for a Hassle-Free Journey

- **Choose a Comfortable Layover:** When booking flights, opt for a layover of 2-3 hours. This minimizes stress and gives you a comfortable break.
- **Pre-Book Ferries & Activities:** During peak season (December-January), it is crucial to pre-book your inter-island ferries and popular activities like scuba diving to avoid disappointment.
- **Cash is King:** While UPI is available in some places, network connectivity can be patchy. Always carry sufficient cash for local transport, small eateries, and markets.
