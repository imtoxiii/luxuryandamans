## Swapping the Deccan Plateau for Tropical Shores: Your Pune to Andaman Guide

Ready to trade the pleasant climate of Pune for the stunning turquoise waters and white sandy beaches of the Andaman Islands? An island getaway is the perfect antidote to city life, and this guide is specially designed for Punekars. We'll walk you through the smartest way to travel, what to do, and how to budget for an unforgettable trip in 2025.

## Flights: Planning Your Journey from Pune (PNQ) to Port Blair (IXZ)

While there are no direct flights from Pune, a smooth one-stop journey is easy to plan.

- **Flight Routes:** Your best bet is to take a flight from Pune to a major hub like Chennai, Bangalore, or Mumbai, and then a connecting flight to Port Blair. Chennai and Bangalore usually offer the quickest layovers.
- **Key Airlines:** IndiGo, Vistara, and Air India offer seamless connectivity on these routes.
- **Total Travel Time:** Expect a total travel time of 6 to 8 hours, including a comfortable layover.
- **Booking Tip:** To get the best fares (usually ₹8,000 - ₹14,000 one-way), book your tickets at least 45-60 days in advance. Booking the two legs of the journey separately can sometimes be cheaper, but a single booking is more convenient if there are delays.

## The Perfect 7-Day Itinerary for Pune Travelers

This itinerary is paced perfectly to help you unwind after your travel day.

- **Day 1: Arrival & Local Vistas:** After arriving in Port Blair, check into your hotel. Spend a relaxed evening at Marina Park, enjoying the sea breeze and local snacks.
- **Day 2-4: Havelock Island Adventures:** Take a morning ferry to Havelock (Swaraj Dweep). Over the next three days, you can witness the magical sunset at Radhanagar Beach, go snorkeling at Elephant Beach, and explore the vibrant cafes.
- **Day 5-6: Neil Island's Rustic Charm:** Hop on a ferry to the quieter Neil Island (Shaheed Dweep). Visit the awe-inspiring Natural Bridge at low tide and relax on the serene beaches of Bharatpur and Laxmanpur.
- **Day 7: Departure:** Take a morning ferry back to Port Blair to catch your connecting flight back to Pune.

## A Realistic Budget for a Couple's Trip from Pune

Here is an estimated budget for a comfortable 7-day trip for two.

- **Return Flights:** ₹32,000 - ₹55,000 (booking in advance is key to saving here)
- **Inter-Island Ferries:** ₹8,000 - ₹12,000
- **Accommodation:** ₹30,000 - ₹70,000
- **Activities & Water Sports:** ₹10,000 - ₹25,000
- **Food & Local Transport:** ₹12,000 - ₹20,000

**Total Estimated Cost for a Couple:** ₹92,000 - ₹1,82,000

## Key Tips for a Smooth Trip from Pune

- **Long Weekend Planning:** The Andamans are a great destination for long weekends. Plan your trip around public holidays to save on leave.
- **Pack for Humidity:** While you might be used to Pune's dry weather, the Andamans are humid. Pack light, quick-drying clothes.
- **Digital Detox:** Mobile connectivity is limited outside Port Blair. Prepare for a digital detox and enjoy the stunning nature around you.
