# Pack Light, Travel Green: The 2026 Checklist

Andaman is a fragile ecosystem. In 2026, strict rules are in place to protect it (like the plastic ban). Here is how to pack responsibly.

## The "Must-Haves"

### 1. Reef-Safe Sunscreen
Regular sunscreen contains Oxybenzone, which kills corals.
- **Bring:** Mineral-based sunscreens (Zinc Oxide/Titanium Dioxide).
- **Avoid:** Anything with "Benzone" in the ingredients.

### 2. Reusable Water Bottle
Single-use plastic bottles are banned in many areas.
- **Bring:** An insulated metal bottle. Most hotels and cafes offer free filtered water refills.

### 3. Waterproof Dry Bag
To keep your phone and wallet safe on ferry rides and beach days.

### 4. Quick-Dry Towel
Microfiber towels dry in minutes and don't trap sand. Perfect for beach hopping.

### 5. Slip-on Shoes / Aqua Shoes
- **Flip-flops:** For the beach.
- **Aqua Shoes:** Essential if you plan to swim in rocky areas (like Elephant Beach) to protect your feet from dead coral.

## What NOT to Bring
- **Plastic Bags:** Strictly banned. You will be fined at the airport.
- **Shells/Corals:** Do **NOT** pick up shells from the beach. Airport scanners will find them, and you will face a heavy fine and potential jail time. Leave them where they belong.

## Clothing
- **Fabrics:** Cotton and Linen. It gets humid!
- **Style:** Beach casual. Shorts and tees are fine everywhere.
- **Modesty:** Cover up when visiting town areas or markets. Swimwear is for the beach only.

**Pack smart, save the reef!**

            answer: "Domestic passengers can carry up to 2 liters (check airline rules). But alcohol is easily available in Andaman."
