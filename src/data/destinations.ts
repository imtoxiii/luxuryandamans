    longDescription: `The Cellular Jail, also known as Kala Pani, is a colonial prison situated in Port Blair. It was used by the British to exile Indian political prisoners to the remote archipelago. Today, it stands as a national memorial and museum showcasing India's struggle for independence.

    Completed in 1906, this prison was designed for solitary confinement with seven blocks radiating from a central tower. Many freedom fighters including Vinayak Damodar Savarkar were imprisoned here. The jail is famous for its Light and Sound Show that narrates the heroic saga of the Indian freedom struggle.`,

    The bridge is formed by years of natural erosion and coral growth, creating a stunning arch-like structure. It's best visited during low tide when you can walk closer to the formation and get better photographs.`,

    longDescription: `The Limestone Caves of Baratang are among the most spectacular natural formations in the Andaman Islands. These caves, formed over millions of years, feature stunning stalactites and stalagmites that create an otherworldly underground landscape.

    The journey to the caves is an adventure itself, involving a boat ride through mangrove creeks and a trek through dense forest. The caves are home to various species of bats and offer a unique spelunking experience.`,

    The area around the mud volcano is characterized by bubbling mud pools and occasional small eruptions of mud and gas. It's one of the few places in India where you can witness such geological activity.`,

    description: "Twin islands connected by a natural sandbar",
    longDescription: `Ross and Smith Islands are twin islands connected by a natural white sand bar that appears during low tide. This phenomenon creates one of the most spectacular and unique beaches in the Andaman Islands.

    During low tide, you can walk from one island to another on the natural sandbar, offering a surreal experience of walking on water. The islands are known for their pristine beaches, clear waters, and excellent snorkeling opportunities.`,

    name: "Cinque Island",
    description: "Pristine uninhabited island paradise",
    longDescription: `Cinque Island is an uninhabited island known for its pristine beaches, crystal-clear waters, and vibrant coral reefs. The island is actually two islands - North Cinque and South Cinque - connected by a thin strip of white sand that appears and disappears with the tides.

    This untouched paradise offers some of the best snorkeling and diving opportunities in the Andaman Islands. The island is accessible only by chartered boats and requires special permits, making it perfect for day trips for those seeking an authentic off-the-beaten-path experience.

    The pristine environment, complete absence of commercial development, and restriction on visitor numbers have preserved Cinque Island as one of the last truly wild places in the Andaman archipelago. The crystal-clear waters provide visibility of up to 30 meters, making it a snorkeler's and diver's paradise with some of the most vibrant coral reefs in the Indian Ocean.`,

    name: "Barren Island",
    description: "India's only active volcano",
    longDescription: `Barren Island is home to India's only active volcano and is located about 135 km northeast of Port Blair. The volcano has been active since 1787 with the most recent eruption occurring in 2017, making it one of the few consistently active volcanoes in South Asia.

    The island is uninhabited and can only be approached by boat from a safe distance due to ongoing volcanic activity. The volcanic activity has created a unique marine ecosystem around the island, making it an excellent spot for deep-sea diving and marine life observation.

    This extraordinary geological wonder offers visitors a rare opportunity to witness an active volcano in the Indian Ocean. The island's volcanic landscape, combined with the crystal-clear waters surrounding it, creates a surreal and awe-inspiring experience. The nutrient-rich volcanic waters have fostered exceptional marine biodiversity, making the surrounding waters a haven for manta rays, whale sharks, and diverse coral species.`,
